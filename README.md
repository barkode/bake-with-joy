## Design

The design was built on the principle of simplicity. The site should be simple
and at the same time user-friendly.

- ### Website structure

The site consists of 5 pages. The navigation menu is available on all pages.

- The home page presents the main idea of ​​the site.

- On the second page, you can see a gallery presenting examples of products.

- The third page is a page with contacts and a feedback form.

- The last two pages are service pages. One of them shows a message that the
  form has been completed, and the other reports that an error has occurred. The
  home page is the default download page.

- The header is fixed on the page, so it is available to the client at any time.

- The logo is located in the upper left corner and the navigation menu is
  located in the right corner. On devices with a small screen, this navigation
  menu changes to a drop-down menu.

- Also on the site there is a lower part - a footer. With its help, the client
  can go to the page of one of the social networks.

- ### Typography

Geometric sans serif typefaces have always been popular, and with support for
both the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, Poppins is an internationalist
addition to the genre. Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more
constructed and rationalist than is typical. The font family
'[Poppins](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts/poppins?subsets=latin)' was downloaded
and used from Google Fonts, as it provides an easy-on-the-eye font. This font
was used for all text across the website.
