Geometric sans serif typefaces have always been popular, and with support for
both the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, Poppins is an internationalist
addition to the genre. Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more

'[Poppins](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts/poppins?subsets=latin)' was downloaded
and used from Google Fonts, as it provides an easy-on-the-eye font. This font
was used for all text across the website.
